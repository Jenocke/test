#summary This is page for ideal on how to improve jobs and buildings.

Something we should fix is that the game has too many jobs that are too similar to each other. As a gamer i have no idea why i should send a girl to whore on the Gambling Hall or on the Brothel (the street thing is fine though).

= Bar =
  * Barmaid-  Actually add drinks to the game.  Maybe link it up with the get milked job.
  * Waitress-
  * Singer- maybe add a few more instruments and make it a band.  Have it increase the amount of people who come to the bar or something.
  * Piano-
= Gambling hall =
  * Dealer- Add odds to the job lvl for pay.  Better a girl is better ur odds of winning are.
  * Entertainment- Way to increase people coming to the hall
  * xxx- Make the patrons more horny increasing there chance of buying a whore
= Strip club =
  * Waitress-
  * Bar tender-
  * Stripper- Add lap dances of different lvls.
= Brothel =
  * Masseuse
  * Peep show
  * Stripper
    * Perhaps a way to increase the libido? In my games i use the Game Dealer as a way to rest the girl and increase her libido in the same time.
= Stables =
  * Milked- Link it to barmaid as a type of drink to serve
= Clinic =
  * Nurse-
= Centre =
= Studio =
= Arena =
