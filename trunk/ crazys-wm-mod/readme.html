<p>How you can help keep this program alive and in development?
There are several ways...</p>
<p>Come up with features or changes you would like added. This is important since your feedback is very important to the development of the game. Any ideas that players come up
with that are not stupid will be added to my list of things to add. I expect to release new
versions of the game at least every 2 weeks. The amount added in these releases will vary
according to the time I am able to spend on the game.</p>

<p>Since I am currently unemployed donating money helps me survive and also gives me heaps of motivation.
It also all goes a long way to helping me to convince my wife that the time I spend on this and future games isn't a waste and will enable me to spend even more time on development.</p>

<p>Donate Here (donate what you think my work is worth, how much would you pay to keep this going for another year?):<form action="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr" method="post">

<p>Spread this game. Give it to everyone who will probably like to play it. When you do make sure you include this file as the whole point of spreading the game is so more people
can contribtue ideas or donations in the form of whatever.</p>

<p>Add your own girls and stories. This game is designed to be added to. That means you can add your own girls, images, and scripts (making your own little stories).</p>
