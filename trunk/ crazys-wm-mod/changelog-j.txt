###  Changes 6/4/2014
Changed how whores use magic to charm their customers happier
Updated cGirlTorture::IsGirlInjured to include possibility of loosing "Tough" trait at 1% and Insemination pregnancy

###  Changes 6/5/2014
I am making it so that if TortureTraitWeekMod is set to -1 in the config.xml it makes torture harsher.
 - This will make "Broken Will", "Masochist" and "Mind Fucked" permanent.
 - It will double the chance of greatly injuring girls when torturing them and damage is increased by half (7-21 instead of 5-14).
 - Also doubles any evil gained.

###  Changes 6/6/2014
I changed it so the the security level goes down by 1 per attacker before checking if they get though.
 - Then, if any attackers survive, the security level goes down by 5 per attacker who survived.

Added do_daily_items code
Some items have variations that have spaces, commas and/or periods to differentiate them so I added functions to assist in comparing strings 
 - "stringtolower(string name)" to allow easier string conversion to all lower case
 - "stringtolowerj(string name)" to allow easier string conversion to all lower case while removing spaces, commas and periods
 - "HasItemJ(sGirl* girl, string name)" to check if a girl has an item by comparing them with "stringtolowerj"
Some items are hard coded into do_daily_items
Started making xml loading for do_daily_items tests, nothing in it yet.

###  Changes 6/7/2014
Corrected a few typos
I have made some changes to the torture code in order to make the images displayed for torture be from an image list specifically for torture.
 - If you name some images with the prefix "torture #.*g" they will show up when you or one of your girls tortures a girl in the dungeon.
 - If you have no "torture #.*g", it defaults to "bdsm #.*g" then to "profile #.*g".
While I was adding that, I went ahead and added pregnancy pictures for all image types that didn't already have them.
I also fixed a bug where "preg #.*g" would only work with numbers 1-9, not with spaces or ().

###  Changes 6/8/2014
Changed m_DayJob and m_NightJob to unsigned int instead of unsigned char
Added m_PrevWorkingDay, m_YesterDayJob and m_YesterNightJob to allow for multiday jobs to be continued if accidentally changed before hitting next week
Rehab and clinic surgery jobs now say how long they have left. "jobname (#)*" where surgery jobs have the * note in their job description
If Rehab or a surgery job are changed while in progress, " **" is added to the new job name with the ** note after the job description
If an interrupted multiday job is not changed back before the next week, all progress from the old multiday job is lost.
Chopped out a lot of useless debug logging
Fixed bug "if you have no Non-Human Random Girls breaking combat jobs"
 - Beast Capture, City Guard, Explore Catacombs, Fight Arena Girls and Fight Beast reworked
Updated City Guard job for xp/skill/stat gains and results in change to Player's Suspicion level instead of Disposition.
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! pushed version .05p
Crazy added Medicine and Performance skills and updated some jobs to use them

Xp to level up is now (current level+1)*125  -  until level 255 then it is 32000xp per level
Many jobs now include the new Medicine or Performance skills in their JobPerformance and skill gains.
Even if there is no Camera Mage or Crystal Purifier on duty, the Stagehand will still clean the studio a little.

###  Changes 6/11-13/2014
Reworked Job Ratings system
 - All jobs that have job performance modifiers are listed in the new third details page.
 - Sex jobs, Actress, and other jobs that do not require stats/skills to do better at are not included.
 - Ratings are (in order of best to worst) 'I' 'S' 'A' 'B' 'C' 'D' 'E' 'X'
 - 'X' is for jobs that the girl can not do if she is a slave.

********** There are a lot of changes with this so exact changelog of it would be rather long  so I will just cpoy/paste moy notes from the forum **********
*                                                                                                                                                          *
*   .06.00.11 is taking a lot longer to get finished than I anticipated.  :'(                                                                              *
*                                                                                                                                                          *
*   I am reflowing the other non-brothel buildings to bring them in line with the movie studio's flow style.                                               *
*   While I was doing that, I found a few bugs in several places.                                                                                          *
*   Also I added the Footjob skill to go with the Film Footjob scenes and added sex restriction checkboxes for footjob and strip.                          *
*    - Footjob is not used by anything yet.                                                                                                                *
*   I changed the way the Film Random job chooses what to film as well as how the Director assigns actresses if they have no job.                          *
*    - Both take into account skill levels and sex restrictions in a more efficient way.                                                                   *
*   I fixed a bug in the out of building check (I had a && instead of an || so it did not work at all)                                                     *
*    - I also added checking of previous day jobs for out of building so if she gets put back to work, it will not be to an out of building job.           *
*                                                                                                                                                          *

###  Changes 12/22/2014
!! bsin posted several spell checks and additions
[from his readme.txt included with the updates]
Few notes on changes in these files:

cGirls.cpp
Changed the action texts for sex activities to make them a little less copy/pastey.

cInventory.cpp
Added a bit to give the player some kindness for giving girls expensive cures. Given the scarcity and cost of cures (relative to cost of just buying a new girl), this should be a "kind" act imho

WorkBrothelStripper.cpp
WorkBarStripper.cpp
Typo fixes and new events, INCLUDING a new event where addicts are exploited by a customer who gives them drugs. I haven't yet tested this and am not 100% confident it will work - **please check**

WorkBarmaid.cpp
WorkBarPiano.cpp
WorkBarSinger.cpp
WorkBarWaitress.cpp
WorkBrothelMassusse.cpp
WorkBrothelWhore.cpp
Typo fixes, cleanup, some rephrasing and some new 'random'ish events.

BugFix: **WorkBarSinger.cpp**
Fixed some lines of code near the end that overwrite (using =) the happiness/fame instead of incrementing/decrementing (using +=)

Hope this helps...
[end]

[excerpt from his readme.txt included with the updates]
#Core changes
cGirls.cpp
+ A comment indicated that the list of "traits" used in customer decisions on girltype needed to be sorted.
+++ Now ALL traits are sorted and grouped into types (large groups are also ordered alphebetically)
+++ Updated to include ALL current traits (as of v126).
+++ Values added so that customer decision is influence by many new traits.
+++ Unused/invisible traits commented out to optimise performance.
+ Some new traits (the one I wanted to use) now have ApplyTrait and UnapplyTrait values, meaning they affect skills, stats and likes.
+ New xxx events and dialogues based on new and existing traits.


#Gambling hall -
WorkHallDealer.cpp
WorkHallXXXEntertainer.cpp
WorkHallEntertainer.cpp
+BUGFIX: Fixed a recurring logic bug that was causing certain events to be much more likely than intended (logical operator precedence means that ANDs are processed before ORs - see example code below)
+New skill-levelled events.
+New random/trait-based after-events for both types of entertainment and dealer.
+New random/trait-based *PRE*-events for both types of entertainment - e.g. if she has high libido today it may affect her performance.


#Whorking Girls
WorkHallWhore.cpp
WorkBrothelWhore.cpp
+ Some additional PossiblyGainTrait gains, to bring some of the new traits into action.

#ALL

 - The mother's age is calculated from the oldest daughters age.
