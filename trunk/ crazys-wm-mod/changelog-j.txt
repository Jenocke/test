### Planned/Reccomended changes:
Add Inventory page keys:
   5/t - Owner Left up/down
   g/b - Item Left up/down
   6/y - Item group up/down
   7/u - Owner Right up/down

   *No keys for buy/sell or equip/unequip
Add right click menus
Transfer screen - Add Health, Happy, Tired and Rebel columns

Recode for config files "config.xml", "ScreenMode.txt" to make 1 file in the directory that has the EXE file
Make the game create the "Saves" folder if it does not exist
Either combine "Resources/Buttons" into "Resources/Images" or combine both into "Resources/Interface/(individiual interface folder)/Images"
Allow for subfolders in "Resources" folders. Would allow:
   Girls folders to contain the "girlsx" files
   Subfolders for each image type to cleanup massive image count girls
Items page - Add location filter
? Items page - Add (does the girl have this item?) filter - if an item is selected, (who has one of these)'s line changes color?
Girl Detail page - add +/- buttons to "House Percentage" (slider can sometimes be difficult)
Brothel page - Add "Manage Inventory" button

Items - Cleaned and reorganized files.
Items - Moved "Gantz Suit" and "Succubus' Wardress" from armor to clothes to allow brothel workers not to unequip them loosing their bonuses.
