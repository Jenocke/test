###  Changes 6/4/2014
Changed how whores use magic to charm their customers happier
Updated cGirlTorture::IsGirlInjured to include possibility of loosing "Tough" trait at 1% and Insemination pregnancy

###  Changes 6/5/2014
I am making it so that if TortureTraitWeekMod is set to -1 in the config.xml it makes torture harsher.
 - This will make "Broken Will", "Masochist" and "Mind Fucked" permanent.
 - It will double the chance of greatly injuring girls when torturing them and damage is increased by half (7-21 instead of 5-14).
 - Also doubles any evil gained.

###  Changes 6/6/2014
I changed it so the the security level goes down by 1 per attacker before checking if they get though.
 - Then, if any attackers survive, the security level goes down by 5 per attacker who survived.

Added do_daily_items code
Some items have variations that have spaces, commas and/or periods to differentiate them so I added functions to assist in comparing strings 
 - "stringtolower(string name)" to allow easier string conversion to all lower case
 - "stringtolowerj(string name)" to allow easier string conversion to all lower case while removing spaces, commas and periods
 - "HasItemJ(sGirl* girl, string name)" to check if a girl has an item by comparing them with "stringtolowerj"
Some items are hard coded into do_daily_items
Started making xml loading for do_daily_items tests, nothing in it yet.

###  Changes 6/7/2014
Corrected a few typos
I have made some changes to the torture code in order to make the images displayed for torture be from an image list specifically for torture.
 - If you name some images with the prefix "torture #.*g" they will show up when you or one of your girls tortures a girl in the dungeon.
 - If you have no "torture #.*g", it defaults to "bdsm #.*g" then to "profile #.*g".
While I was adding that, I went ahead and added pregnancy pictures for all image types that didn't already have them.
I also fixed a bug where "preg #.*g" would only work with numbers 1-9, not with spaces or ().

###  Changes 6/8/2014
Changed m_DayJob and m_NightJob to unsigned int instead of unsigned char
Added m_PrevWorkingDay, m_YesterDayJob and m_YesterNightJob to allow for multiday jobs to be continued if accidentally changed before hitting next week
Rehab and clinic surgery jobs now say how long they have left. "jobname (#)*" where surgery jobs have the * note in their job description
If Rehab or a surgery job are changed while in progress, " **" is added to the new job name with the ** note after the job description
If an interrupted multiday job is not changed back before the next week, all progress from the old multiday job is lost.
Chopped out a lot of useless debug logging
Fixed bug "if you have no Non-Human Random Girls breaking combat jobs"
 - Beast Capture, City Guard, Explore Catacombs, Fight Arena Girls and Fight Beast reworked
Updated City Guard job for xp/skill/stat gains and results in change to Player's Suspicion level instead of Disposition.
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! pushed version .05p
Crazy added Medicine and Performance skills and updated some jobs to use them

Multiday jobs now change their (#) based on if there is a Nurse or Doctor is on duty.

Changed skill and stat types from "unsigned char" to "int" to get rid of 255<->0 wrap around problems
Xp to level up is now (current level+1)*125  -  until level 255 then it is 32000xp per level
Many jobs now include the new Medicine or Performance skills in their JobPerformance and skill gains.
Even if there is no Camera Mage or Crystal Purifier on duty, the Stagehand will still clean the studio a little.

###  Changes 6/11-13/2014
Reworked Job Ratings system
 - All jobs that have job performance modifiers are listed in the new third details page.
 - Sex jobs, Actress, and other jobs that do not require stats/skills to do better at are not included.
 - Ratings are (in order of best to worst) 'I' 'S' 'A' 'B' 'C' 'D' 'E' 'X'
 - 'X' is for jobs that the girl can not do if she is a slave.
