### Planned/Reccomended changes:
Make separate file for "Rebelliousness" calculation so it can be added back to all girl lists.
Add Inventory page keys:
   5/t - Owner Left up/down
   g/b - Item Left up/down
   6/y - Item group up/down
   7/u - Owner Right up/down
   j/m - Item Right up/down
   *No keys for buy/sell or equip/unequip
Add right click menus
Transfer screen - Add Health, Happy, Tired and Rebel columns
Transfer screen - Add Girl count above columns and/or on location lists
Recode for config files "config.xml", "ScreenMode.txt" to make 1 file in the directory that has the EXE file
Make the game create the "Saves" folder if it does not exist
Move "itemsx" files from "Resources/Data" to "Resources/Items"
Either combine "Resources/Buttons" into "Resources/Images" or combine both into "Resources/Interface/(individiual interface folder)/Images"
Allow for subfolders in "Resources" folders. Would allow:
   Girls folders to contain the "girlsx" files
   Subfolders for each image type to cleanup massive image count girls
Items page - Add location filter
? Items page - Add (does the girl have this item?) filter - if an item is selected, (who has one of these)'s line changes color?
Girl Detail page - add +/- buttons to "House Percentage" (slider can sometimes be difficult)
Brothel page - Add "Manage Inventory" button










### Changes April 2014:
Items - Cleaned and reorganized files.
Items - Moved "Gantz Suit" and "Succubus' Wardress" from armor to clothes to allow brothel workers not to unequip them loosing their bonuses.
Items - Renamed same-named items to allow the game to save the exact variation of the item with minimal visiual effect in the game.
Items - Added alternate "sellers" some of items - allowing items to be more common but at higher prices. - Items keep the same name so they merge with the original item when the game is reloaded.

###  Changes 5/11/2014
Replaced all references to "pinkpetal.co.cc" with "pinkpetal.org" since the old site no longer works.
Sidestep fix for the "Send to dungeon" bug
 - All buildings now set where the girl is when loading so the "Send to dungeon" button does not show in girl details unless she is in a main brothel
 - - (for a proper fix that allows sending girls to the dungeon from any building, much more coding will be required)
Fixed movies to store their own runweeks - this fixes the 35 week crash bug
Added more movie storage options:
	<Movies>
		<Movie Init_Qual="940" Qual="799" Promo_Qual="1412" Money_Made="1412" RunWeeks="1" />
		<Movie Init_Qual="839" Qual="839" Promo_Qual="0" Money_Made="0" RunWeeks="0" />
	</Movies>
